2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net digit_o_reg[0]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin digit_o_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell digit_o_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net digit_o_reg[1]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin digit_o_reg[1]_LDC_i_1/O, cell digit_o_reg[1]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net digit_o_reg[2]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin digit_o_reg[2]_LDC_i_1/O, cell digit_o_reg[2]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net digit_o_reg[3]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin digit_o_reg[3]_LDC_i_1/O, cell digit_o_reg[3]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net digit_o_reg[4]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin digit_o_reg[4]_LDC_i_1/O, cell digit_o_reg[4]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net digit_o_reg[5]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin digit_o_reg[5]_LDC_i_1/O, cell digit_o_reg[5]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net digit_o_reg[6]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin digit_o_reg[6]_LDC_i_1/O, cell digit_o_reg[6]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
