# FPGA

This is a repository with my own personal attempts for FPGA programming.
To open a project, open the .xpr file inside the project folder. Source code is located in the .src file inside the project files.

These program are written specifically for our ALINX AX7035 FPGA dev board.

The following are the projects files:
## lcd_hex
This folder consists of the program that will display a hexidecimal counter with 1 increment per second.

## led_blink
This folder consists of the program that will have the on board LEDs blink in different patterns.

## test_pattern_gen
This folder consists of the video test pattern generator. It is not implemented on our FPGA yet.
